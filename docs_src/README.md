# RTS APP TV #


### RTS TV App Framework ###
## Documentation ##
Due to the complexity to create documentation for react native, especially components.
We created a folder, named docs_src.
In this folder there is 2 folders, one is a template for jsDoc and the other is /components, to build all exported components.
If you have to add or modified a component,
you have to report the modification or the new component in this folder.
